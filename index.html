            href="https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/liberation-museum-inspires-youth">(CAG)</a> It’s the only museum
             in the region that displays the history of people who are still alive
             the fact that the museum embodies the story of people 
             like President Paul Kagame and many members of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), 
             who are still alive, makes it extremely exciting to visit,
             especially by young people who want to learn about the country’s history.
             This is of great interest for visitors because it makes the museum’s content more authentic.

        <h3> THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST GENOCIDE IS ALSO OUR AIRMS </h3>

       <p>
            CAG museum is built in the Parliamentary building in Kigali,
            which was once known as Conseil National de Development (CND),
            and which harbors a lot of memories of the struggle to liberate the country,
            which was mounted by the Rwanda Patriotic Front, through its armed wing, 
            the Rwanda Patriotic Army.
            That order is famously known as the ‘order to stop the genocide’
            and it marks the beginning of a four-month campaign against Genocide
            that led Rwanda to Liberation Day on July 4, 1994 and continued until August 22,
            1994 when the government army that was committing genocide (FAR) and
            its interahamwe militia were pushed out of the country.
